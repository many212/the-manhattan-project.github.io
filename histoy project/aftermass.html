    The Manhattan Project was a secret research and development project that produced <br> the first atomic bombs during World War II. The project was led by the United States with the support of<br> the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie R.<br> Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was administered by the U.S. Department of War.

    The Manhattan Project was successful in developing two atomic bombs, which were used <br> against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The bombings resulted in <br> the deaths of an estimated 129,000 people, and they brought about the end of World War II.

    <h2>The beginning of the nuclear age</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
    The development of the atomic bomb ushered in the nuclear age, a new era in human history<br> that is characterized by the threat of nuclear war. The nuclear age has also seen the development<br> of nuclear power, which is a controversial source of energy.

    <h2>The Cold War arms race</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
    The development of the atomic bomb also led to the Cold War arms race, a period of intense<br> competition between the United States and the Soviet Union for nuclear superiority. The Cold War arms<br> race lasted for nearly 40 years and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

    <h2>Environmental contamination</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Manhattan Project also had a significant impact on the environment. The production of<br> nuclear weapons resulted in the release of radioactive materials into the environment, which have caused<br> widespread contamination. The environmental legacy of the Manhattan Project continues to be a source of concern today.
