                in during the WW2. the United Stated stareted working on the project <br>
                after they got intel that Germany was creating a davestating bomb. though<br>
                the project was top secret but some other country contributed in the reaseches <br> and development

            <p> <strong>J. Robert Oppenheimer</strong> was the director of the Los Alamos <br>Laboratory Also known as the
                father of atomic bomb <img src="J. Robert Oppenheimer.jpg" alt="J. Robert Oppenheimer">

            <p><strong> Leo Szilard</strong> was a Hungarian physicis who was one of the <br> first to
             propose the idea of an atomic bomb. He was also a key figure in the development <br> of the first nuclear reactor. <img src="Leo Szilard.jpg" alt="Leo Szilard"></p>
            <p> <strong>Hans Bethe</strong> was a German-born physicist who was one of the <br> leading experts on nuclear physics. He played a key role in the development of the theory of nuclear fission, which was essential for the development of the atomic bomb.

           <p><strong> Ernest O. Lawrence</strong> was an American physicist who invented <br> the cyclotron, a device that was used to accelerate particles to high speeds. This was essential for the production of fissile material for the atomic bomb.
